# linear-regression-practice
Practicing linear regression model with a sample dataset. 


In this dataset you have to predict profit depending on R&D Spend, Marketing Spend, Administration Spend and State.


In this workbook I have practised multiple linear regression. 
PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Check the dataset if it needs cleaning.
2. Check the dataset if it needs missing value treatment.
3. Check the dataset if it needs scaling.
4. Split data into training data and testing data.
5. Create a linear regression model to predict profit depending on R&D Spend,	Administration spend,	Marketing Spend and	State.
6. Check the accuracy of your model.

STEPS FOLLOWED
1. Importing required libraries.
2. Loading dataset.
3. Check first five rows of the dataset.
4. Statistical info about dataset.
5. Getting information on dataset.
6. Checking Outliers by plotting boxplot graph in seaborn.
7. Checking unique values in State column and encoding them (I have used label encoder).
8. Scaling the R&D Spend,	Administration spend,	Marketing Spend columns. I have used (standard scaler).
9. Splitting data into training set and testing set.
10. Creating linear regression model.
11. Making predictions using test dataset.
12. Checking the accuracy of the model.
